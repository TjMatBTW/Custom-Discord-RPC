# Custom-Discord-RPC
This code allows you to make your own Custom RPC (or Rich Custom Presence) even tho it's not a game.

Credit to the original coder. If you are having trouble contact me on Discord: TjMat#4979

I usually don't accept friend requests, so if you want to talk to me just join a server where I'm in so you can DM me:

1. Discord Developers:https://discord.gg/discord-developers
2. Discord.py Official Server: https://discord.gg/dpy
3. Python Discord Server: https://discord.gg/python 
4. Discord Testers: https://discord.gg/discord-testers

Steps to follow:


1. Create a file called ``rpc.py`` in a directory of your desktop.
2. Create an application through https://discord.dev/
3. Go back to the discord application.
4. Take the client ID of that application and go to User Settings > Advanced > Application Test Mode and put the ID there.
5. Open the ``rpc.py``file on any text editor. (VSCode, for example)
6. Write down the code (I know y'all just gonna copy and paste) that I provided in the file ``rpc.py`` here in the repository to your file. (MUST BE THE SAME NAME)
7. After that, create a new file (can be named whatever you want) in the folder, and write down the code that i provided in ``rpcsettings``. 
8. Everything between the quotes is customizable.
9. For ``large_image`` and ``small_image`` you need to go to  https://discord.dev/ and upload an asset. Copy the name of it and paste it on the specific line. (Between the quotes)
10. Run the code and that's it.
